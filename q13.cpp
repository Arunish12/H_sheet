/*Leap year rule : 
The year must be divisible by 4. 
If the leap year can also be evenly divided by 100 it is not a leap year unlessâ€¦.
The year is also evenly divisible by 400. 
According to the rule, the following years are leap years: 2400, 2000 while 1800, 1900, 2100, and 2200 are not leap years. 

Write a program to take input of a random year and check whether the year is a leap or not
